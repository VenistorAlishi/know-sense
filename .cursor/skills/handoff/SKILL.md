description: Handoff. Use when this session should leave a continuation artifact for a new session or another agent.

# Handoff

The artifact is a single canonical file - **`docs/handoffs/CURRENT.md`** - that the next session opens with **`@docs/handoffs/CURRENT.md`**.

A handoff is **transient continuation context**, not an archive. There is only ever one of them, and each `/handoff` **overwrites** the previous one.

## Instructions

1. **Next-session focus** - If the user typed text after `/handoff` or described a focus in the same message, use it as the primary goal for the handoff. Otherwise infer the most important continuation goal from the conversation. **Done when**: the next-session goal is one sentence (from the `/handoff` argument, or inferred).
2. **Redact sensitive content** - Before writing, redact API keys, passwords, tokens, and personally identifiable information. Replace each with `[REDACTED]` or a short generic label (e.g. `[REDACTED: API key]`). Do not paste secrets even if they appeared in the chat. **Done when**: every secret in the draft is `[REDACTED]` (or a short generic label).
3. **Extract, do not duplicate** - Do not paste large chunks of specs, plans, ADRs, issues, commit messages, or diffs. **Link** them by workspace path or URL. Quote at most a line or two if absolutely necessary. Capture only what the next agent cannot recover from those links:
   - **Current state** - What works and what was tried. Include **environment** when relevant: branch, uncommitted or dirty tree, services or commands that mattered, tooling versions only if they affected this session.
   - **Preferences (this session):** constraints the user stated in chat (e.g. no commits unless asked, use structured MCQ for discrete choices). Do not copy all of `AGENTS.md` or rules files - only what this thread established.
   - **Decisions and constraints** - Outcomes the next agent must not reverse. Include **rejected or failed approaches** as one line each (`what was tried → why stopped`) so the next agent does not repeat dead ends. If a decision is durable beyond this task, promote it to an ADR and link it here instead of relying on the handoff to preserve it.
   **Done when**: the draft holds current state, this-session preferences, decisions/constraints, and rejected approaches as links plus what the next agent cannot recover from those links - no pasted spec/plan/ADR/diff bodies.
4. **Write to `docs/handoffs/CURRENT.md`** - Follow **Output Location** below. Create `docs/handoffs/` if missing. If `CURRENT.md` already exists, **overwrite it** (do not create a second handoff file). **Done when**: `docs/handoffs/CURRENT.md` exists (or the user-asked temp path) and is the only handoff file in `docs/handoffs/`.
5. **Fill the template** - Copy the structure from **Handoff Template**, omit empty sub-bullets and sections, and keep bullets tight. **Done when**: the file matches the template, empty sections omitted.
6. **Skills** - In the template, list **Cursor Agent Skills** the next session should consider (invoke with **`/skill-name`** per [Agent Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/skills)). Only suggest skills that clearly match the **remaining next actions** - not every skill that might ever apply. **Done when**: every listed skill matches a remaining next action, or the section is omitted.
7. **Finish** - Reply with **`@docs/handoffs/CURRENT.md`** (or the temp path) and a one-line instruction to open it in the next session. If any link target was cited from memory and might be wrong, mark it **verify** or omit it. **Done when**: the reply is that path plus the one-liner, and every cited link is a real path/URL or marked **verify**.

## Output Location

**Default (always, unless the user asks otherwise):**

`docs/handoffs/CURRENT.md`

- A single canonical file. Each `/handoff` overwrites it - the previous handoff is intentionally not preserved.
- The next session always opens the same path: **`@docs/handoffs/CURRENT.md`**. No lookup, no archive folder, no timestamped variants.
- Need lasting history? It is already in your **chat history** (raw) and your **ADRs** (distilled decisions). The handoff does not duplicate either.

**Fallback (only when the user asks for a temporary or private handoff, or the workspace must not get a new file):**

- A path from `mktemp` (or OS temp). State clearly in the reply that the file is **outside the workspace** and the user must paste or attach it for the next session.

## Handoff Template

Use this structure inside the written file (replace placeholders; delete sub-bullets and sections with nothing useful):

```markdown
# Handoff: <short title>

**For next session:** <one sentence - what to accomplish first>

**Created:** <ISO date or YYYY-MM-DD>

## Current state

- <what works, what was tried>
- **Environment:** <branch, uncommitted changes, relevant runtime context - or omit>
- **Preferences (this session):** <user-stated constraints from chat - or omit>

## Decisions and constraints

- <decisions the next agent must not reverse>
- **Rejected / failed:** <approach → why not pursued - or omit>

## Links (no prose duplication)

- Plan / Spec: <path or URL>
- ADR: <path or URL>
- Issue / ticket: <path or URL>
- PR / diff: <path or URL>

## Blockers and open questions

- <or "None">

## Next actions (ordered)

1. <smallest concrete step>
2. …

## Suggested Cursor skills

- `/skill-name` - <why, tied to next actions>
```
